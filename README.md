These programs build an intuitive book recommendation service for English learning
students using Google Books API. The user will interact with the system by querying
in an initial keyword, and the system will return several recommended keywords to
narrow down the suggestion scope. A user profile is built through several rounds of simple user-item
interaction using buttons. A final recommendation will be
presented to the user when the system decides whether the amount of collected profile
is sufficient.
